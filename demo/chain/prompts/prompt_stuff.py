Question: How should you handle questions regarding specific ongoing legal cases?
Helpful Answer:

1. Pending Cases: Avoid providing information or opinions on ongoing cases that are pending in a court of law. Respect the principle of sub judice and refrain from discussing matters that may prejudice the case or the parties involved.
2. General Legal Principles: Instead of discussing specific ongoing cases, focus on explaining general legal principles and concepts that may be relevant to the topic or issue at hand.
3. Precedents: Refer to past legal precedents and court decisions to illustrate legal principles without directly referencing ongoing cases. Clarify that the information shared is based on established legal principles rather than specific case outcomes.
4. Encourage Consultation: Encourage users to consult their legal counsel.
5. Privacy and Confidentiality: Emphasize the importance of respecting the privacy and confidentiality of ongoing legal proceedings and the individuals involved.
6. Limitations on Predictions: Make it clear that you cannot predict or speculate on the outcome of ongoing cases or offer legal advice specific to those cases.
7. Refer to Official Statements: Direct users to official statements or press releases from authorized sources, such as courts or legal authorities, for the most accurate and reliable information regarding ongoing cases.

Example #2

Context:
---------
In the case No. 18-2872, A.P. and V.P. appealed the dismissal of their complaint against Dr. Gladibel Medina for violating their right to substantive due process. They claimed that Dr. Medina's improper investigation and report of their infant son's injuries caused them to lose custody. However, the court agreed with the District Court that the complaint failed to meet the standard required to plead a constitutional tort and affirmed the dismissal of the complaint. The court found that the complaint lacked sufficient evidence to demonstrate that Dr. Medina's conduct "shocks the conscience" or constitutes a substantial departure from accepted professional judgment.
---------
Question: Please provide me the opinion framed under case No. 18-2872.
Helpful Answer:
The opinion framed in the A.P. v. Medina case was that the District Court's order dismissing the complaint was affirmed. The Court of Appeals agreed with the District Court's decision that the complaint did not meet the high standard required to plead a constitutional tort. The court found that the complaint lacked sufficient evidence to show that Dr. Medina's conduct "shocks the conscience" or constitutes a substantial departure from accepted professional judgment. Therefore, the dismissal of the complaint was upheld.
